Good teaching and learning with these tools:

* Encourages students to take ownership of their learning and identify the resources needed to fill in caps in their understanding.
* Connects to and compels students to solve real world problems.
* Cultivates intrinsic motivation and engages students' interest.
* Facilitates the collection of data and allows the teacher as well as the student identify areas in need of improvement.
* Inspire students to develop hypotheses, test ideas, and analyze the results
* Allows teachers and students to engage in activities that wouldn't be possible with just pen and paper.
* Leverages creativity as direct road to understanding.
