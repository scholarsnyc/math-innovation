## Student Creations

The team investigates ways for students to create instructional content with their devices. The result of this investigation were a few tasks that could be adapted to any topic. The next step is to begin building inquiry- and project-based units.

* Students will create one screencast a marking period in which they explain a concept that they have mastered recently. The screencast will cover a brief introduction to the topic as well as a step-by-step narrative detailing how he or she tackled that concept.
	* *Tool*: ShowMe or EduCreations Interactive Whiteboard.
	* **Follow-up** (Math Team): Draft a standard rubric.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Devise a sane way of organizing and archiving these videos.
* Students will create on multimedia study guide in iBooks Author each year. These guides will cover a topic from start to finish and will include video, text, and presentations.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Develop a unit for seventh grade technology on using iBooks Author. This should include a rubric for the structure of the book.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Develop a site with a basic introduction for eighth grade students or figure out if there is a PE rotation teacher that can cover this with the students.
	* **Follow-up** (Math Team): Devise a rubric for the content of the iBooks.
* Inquiry/project-based Units to be further developed at a later date.
	* **Follow-up** (Everyone): Begin brainstorming and drafting ideas. Bring at least one idea to the next meeting.
	
## Content Delivery

The team spent a considerable amount of time rethinking and questioning many of the basic routines in day-to-day instruction and classroom management. The focused on developing ways to make better use of instructional time by leveraging the students' devices. What traditional practices need to be rethought and reconsidered in light of students relying on their devices.

* Phase One (Google Sites): Teachers are going to maintain a transparent Google Site with all of their class resources and materials so that students have full access from their devices. This will be the primary avenue for distributing content to students in the beginning of the year.
	* Google Sites was chosen over Edline because:
		* Google Sites has tight integration with Google Docs and allows teachers to seamlessly post their resources, thus being a more efficient use of planning time.
		* Edline logs students out quickly and wastes instructional time.
* Phase Two: A online learning community platform (e.g. Edmodo, BuddyPress)
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Set up a BuddyPress installation on a server so that teachers can kick the tires and get a feel for it.
	**Follow-up** (Math Team): Explore other options (e.g. Edmodo, LearnBoost, Moodle, Ning, etc).
* Flipped classroom model
	* Students will be responsible for having their Evernote notebooks prepared before the beginning of class.
	* Teachers will experiment with making instruction screencasts (or finding them elsewhere) and asking students to watch the videos prior to class. (What is the benchmark or goal for this? How many times a week?)

## Knowledge Management

The team explored ways for students to organize and manage their learning experiences. A wide range of tools were initially considered, but only a few made the cut.

* Evernote: Note taking and organization software that is available on all major platforms as well as the web.
	* The free account is limited to 60MB per month of storage.
	* Theoretically, it would cost $22.50 per student annually (or $10,170 for everyone) to upgrade to Evernote Premium.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Review the 1:1 case studie and Evernote and Apple on the [Evernote for Schools](http://evernote.com/schools/resources/topics/one_to_one/) page and report back to the team.
	* **Follow-up** (Math Team): Review [the case study](http://evernote.com/media/pdf/schools/mka.pdf) on the school that integrated Evernote for one-to-one use.
* Skitch: Drawing and image annotation software that integrates with Evernote.
	* **Follow-up** (Everyone): Watch [the short video](http://www.youtube.com/embed/L0KQbLOPDvc) on integrating Skitch into instruction.
* ShowMe/Educreations: An interactive whiteboard that students and teachers can use to record and share videos.
	* **Follow-up** (Math Team): Figure out which recording tool (see above) we want to go with.

## Requests from Administration

* If teachers are expected to maintain Google Sites with all of their course materials available from parents and teachers, they should be relieved of their responsibility to maintain an Edline page (EasyGradePro aside).
* Student access to the Internet Cafe before and after school and during lunch periods.
* Per Session opportunities to meet twice a month.

## Technical Requests

* Apps and tools loaded ont the devices
	* **Follow-up** (Math Team): Compile a list of apps to be installed on the iPads.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Take the list above and install those applications onto the student iPads.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Order cases for the additional iPads.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Wire up the new carts and install the iPads.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Order additional wires and chargers.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Label and inventory all of the new iPads.
	* **Follow-up** (Steve): Install configuration profiles from Apple Configurator.

## Topics for Future Conversations

* Digital portfolios
* Project-based units
