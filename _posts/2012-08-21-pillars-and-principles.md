## Core Principles

We believe that good teaching and learning:

* Encourages students to take ownership of their learning and identify the resources needed to fill in caps in their understanding.
* Connects to and compels students to solve real world problems.
* Cultivates intrinsic motivation and engages students' interest.
* Facilitates the collection of data and allows the teacher as well as the student identify areas in need of improvement.
* Inspire students to develop hypotheses, test ideas, and analyze the results
* Allows teachers and students to engage in activities that wouldn't be possible with just pen and paper.
* Leverages creativity as direct road to understanding.

## Five Pillars

In order to build lessons and a classroom culture that encourages the core principles above, we need to become comfortable with our tools. Our approach to instruction takes five major forms:

* Tools for Student Creation
* Tools for Student Collaboration
* Tools for Removing Time and Place from Teaching and Learning
* Tools for Delivering Instruction
* Tools for Collecting and Assessing Data
