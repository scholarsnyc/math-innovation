## Objectives

The primary objective of this little get-together is to take some time to:

* Dig into what great teaching looks like in the twenty-first century 
* Explore how we can leverage modern tools in order to create new models of instruction that transform our students from passive recipients of content to active constructors of knowledge.

For the most part, this is uncharted territory and—in many ways—there is no wheel to reinvent: We have to blaze our own trail. Luckily, there are a lot of great tools out there for us to use. Over the next two days, we're going to investigate these tools and figure out what works and what doesn't and how they help us make our ideal classroom experiences a reality.

### End Products

We can wax poetic on the merits of good pedagogy, but to quote Steve Jobs: "[Real artists ship.][ship]" Eight hours is not a lot of time—especially if you've made the mistake of eating a lot of bread for lunch. So, what can we expect to ship at the end of our time together?

1. One common understanding of what we—as a team—believe that learning should be like in the twenty-first century.
2. Four templates for tasks/activities that promote student collaboration and creation. Different content can be plugged in depending on what the curriculum calls for.
3. Drafts of interactive textbooks for two subtopics in the seventh and eighth grade curriculum. The goal is that you will feel comfortable creating content that takes full advantage of the tools at your disposal.
4. Two unit skeletons in the distribution method of our choice (e.g. iTunes U, Edline)

## Guiding Principles

### Rapid Prototyping and Constant Iteration

Rapid prototyping and constant iteration are two popular concepts from software development (although, they are arguably universal principals). The gist of it is that instead of toiling away at something until it is absolutely perfect, it's better to get a rough approximation up and running as fast as possible and then iterate on that prototype based on real world feedback.

### The Cult of Done

The [Cult of Done manifesto][done] was developed by Bre Pettis and Kio Stark in about 20 minutes. Again, the guiding principle—which conveniently is the guiding principle of our eight ours together—is that we want to get stuff created as fast as humanly possible.

## Structure

It would be silly to gather five really smart, mathematics teachers into a room and let one, passably-bright technology teacher lecture them on how to use a set tools. The point of this meeting is to create a framework for great instruction—and this two-day event is structured accordingly.

There are no PowerPoint presentations, no worksheets, and no handouts. The reason we are gathered here is to create useful tools that can be immediately put into practice. That said, there are a few structures that we will be leveraging in order to make the best possible use of our time.

### Design Exercises

Design exercises are taken from the way teams of creatives (e.g. designers, artists) develop idea. We're creatives and we're going to use this structure as a template for prototyping and iterating on our instructional design ideas.

For our purposes, design exercises go as follows:

* Teams break off for a set amount of time and develop a prototype based on whatever we're designing at that given moment. The time limit is non-negotiable and helps us avoid [Parkinson's Law][park].
* At the end of the prototyping phase, we meet up and each team shows off their prototype.
* The other team gives feedback and suggests ideas.
* The teams go back into their separate corners for a fraction of the original time to iterate on their prototype based on feedback.
* There is a second session of feedback and ideas.
* The prototype is published.

We will use design exercises as the primary method for rapidly prototyping ideas and iterating on them quickly.

## Pedagogy

* The research:
	* Technology helps when teaching is project-based, inquiry-driven, and built to take advantage of whatever tool you're using.
	* Technology hurts when you use old models (e.g. "chalk and talk", "sage on the stage").
* This project will fail if we just do the same old thing but with iPads.
* Instead, this is an opportunity to rethink how we go about preparing our students for the modern world.
* There is no reason to think that what may or may not have worked when we were in school is even remotely relevant now. I'll argue that it was outdated and a waste of time back then as well.

> Technology increases student engagement and enhances creativity in classrooms where the teachers have custom-designed their lessons to take advantage of technology. In classrooms that primarily revolve around a teacher lecturing (sometimes referred to as“chalk and talk” or “the sage on the stage” lessons), laptops and other devices are the perfect tool for student distraction and multitasking. Rolling a cart into a classroom and handing the teacher a key does not result in the substantial gains we see in the [research linking student achievement and technology integration][research].
>
> Teachers’ comfort with technology is important, of course, but so are their beliefs in the role technology can plan in their classrooms. It turns out that attitude toward technology can be more important than their adeptness at using it. They key, of course, is professional development.
> 
> Taking a photocopied worksheet and sharing the Microsoft Word file is not an effective way to leverage technology. Instead, what are the lessons that would not be possible without the device you plan on introducing into your classroom?

## Tools for Student Creation

* [ShowMe][] allows you to record screencasts on your iPad. Basically, it gives you a blank white canvas to draw on and records your drawings. From there, you can post it online and push it up the cloud for sharing. In addition, it's a normal video file (not some proprietary format like Jing) and you can download the file and do whatever you want with it.
* [Skitch][] is available on Mac OS X, iOS, and Android and owned by the good folks at Evernote. The app allows you to take photos, screenshots, web pages, maps, or a blank canvas and annotate it with text, arrows, highlights, and drawings. Annotated images can be exported to Evernote, shown on a large screen through an AirPlay device (such as the AppleTV or helpful software such as [AirServer][]), shared via Twitter, emailed, or saved to the camera roll.

## Tools for Removing Time and Place from Teaching and Learning

* [Evernote][]: Evernote is an app for Windows, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, and the web that lets you create notebooks and store useful information. Evernote offers quick searching, tagging, and sorting of your notes through advanced filters. Notes are not limited to text. You can capture audio and pictures as well as store files. Evernote employs state of the art scanning and handwriting detection software to figure out what you’ve written in a photo of a note and adds it to its search index so you can find it easily when you need it. In addition, you can share notebooks with your students or colleagues and since it is multi-platform, notebooks can be accessed from pretty much anywhere.
* [iCloud][]: iCloud is that ubiquitous service that is baked in to every Apple device. It's been pretty well supported on iOS since its inception, but has only recently been fully-baked into Mac OS X. In addition, there is currently a beta of a new web application that allows you to access your iCloud data through a browser. The problem is that there is not central management of student accounts as well as no real way to collaborate on documents. It's worth keeping an eye on iCloud, but it's probably not ready for prime time for our purposes. That said, if students have iCloud accounts and they want to use them, I am okay with that.
* [Dropbox][]: Dropbox is another application for Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Linux, and the web. The premise is simple, it creates a folder on your hard drive conveniently titled “Dropbox.” This folder stays in sync with every other device that you install Dropbox on. Put something in your Dropbox folder on your PC at home and it is instantly available on your classroom computer, your mobile phone, and your iPad.
* [Google Docs][] via [Google Chrome][] and [Google Drive][]: Google Docs has always been a bit wonky on the iPad (or any tablet device for that matter). The situation has improved with Chrome for iOS, but it's still a bit rough around the edges. For the sake of brevity, I will save you a rundown of what Google Docs is and how it can be used.

## Tools for Student Collaboration

* [Wordpress][] is an online blogging platform. You need a server to run it, but we've got servers. Students can comment on readings, post assignments and a myriad of other things. It's all open source with a rich ecosystem of plugins. You can pretty much bend Wordpress to your whim. I often use it as the foundation for bigger and better things. If you have an idea of something custom built that you want, we can talk about building something for you.
* [Ning][] is the original custom social network. It lets you build something similar to Facebook but within your own private walled garden. You have complete control. It's no longer free, but it's relatively inexpensive and we can probably figure out a way to pay for it if you see merit in it and are interested in using it.
* [21Classes][] is more than just a blog. It’s a small network of blogs. Each student gets their own blog and each blog is linked together into a class network. Students can publish text or photos but also create categories or invite classmates as co-authors and more. You control access through usernames and passwords. As a site administrator you may choose to moderate every new entry posted by a student before it is being published in case the entry is in any way inappropriate or you feel that the student should rewrite his/her entry, you may defer publication and inform the student.
* [Collaborize][] is an online platform (with an app in the App Store) that lets you set up a learning community and allow students to comment and discuss instructional content. You can inset polls, hosts debates, and engage students in a myriad of other ways.
* [Edmodo][]: Edmodo is a social learning network for teachers, students, and parents. It's pretty much like a Edline if it was designed in reaction to all of the social media start-ups that have spring up over the course of the last decade.
* [Google Sites][]: It’s not the prettiest, but there are some features that make this a very viable option.  Google Sites plays nicely with the rest of the Google suite of tools. You can embed documents, maps, calendars, and photo galleries. There are some drawbacks, however. Google Sites has a lot of features and can get fidgety. It’s great for setting up a basic website or a digital portfolio of student work, but it’s not necessarily built for the express purpose of setting up a blog and it’s not the most intuitive at times. You can share the site just like you share a document: with the world, with the school, or with only select colleagues or students. If you use Google Apps for Education at your school then you can set permissions and grant access on a student-by-student or class-by-class basis. (**Nota bene**: I have not personally explored how well Google Sites works on the iPad.)

## Tools for Delivering Instruction

* [iBooks Author][] allows you (or your students) to create rich multi-media textbooks with ease. You can build in quizzes, interactive charts and images, embed in Keynote presentations, include HTML5 widgets and a wide range of other digital media. You can distribute them to any iOS device or export them to PDF for use on a computer or any other medium.
* [iTunes U][] is used by Stanford and MIT for their online course initiatives. As of July 25, 2012, Apple just opened up the tool to K-12 teachers to create courses that take advantage of the platform. Courses in iTunes U can pull in videos, iBooks, PDF documents, and other content.
* [Podcasts][] is another innocuously named application by Apple. Basically, it add support for subscribing to podcasts and have updates pushed to them as they become available. The reason that this is cool is that you could make regular audio or video recordings and have them automatically pushed out to subscribing devices. This also means that students could access them from home just as easily as they could from their in-school devices.
* [Edline][] is well-trodden ground and I'll save all of us some time and not elaborate on it.
